# Go Felix!

Go Felix! Is an open game development project born from a silly idea that sparked in the **Autumn 2023 PlayLab** course, taught by Prof. **Miguel Sicart** at the **IT University of Copenhagen**.

### TL;DR

Make a **7 second** minigame **about our friend Felix**!

1. Install **Unity 2022.3.8f1**
2. Clone or download the project
3. Create a folder in **02 YOUR GAME(S) HERE** and name it the same as your minigame
4. Copy the scene from **01 COMMON ASSETS** in your folders.
5. Keep all your assets inside your folder and (please) don't touch already existing prefabs and the **00 DO NOT TOUCH (please)** folder.
6. Hand in by making a **pull request** or uploading your minigame folder **[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Jneb9vUqB7atdeC6yFA2M4hiEQdCK5R?usp=sharing)**.
7. Quick rules:
    1. Use the correct unity version
    2. Do not use tags or physics layers  
        1. Or if you do, don't change the layer names. Just use numbers.     
    3. Use specific names for Monobehaviours or ideally use namespaces.
    4. Make sure your game is completed in 7 seconds, because it will be automatically termianted after that time.

### About the project

The best way to describe this project is by calling it a **WarioWare-Like**. It's going to be a collection of minigames created by... whoever! All you need to make one is just a bit of experience with Unity.

Think of this project like a **365 days a year game jam** with two core components: one limitation and one theme.

The theme is our friend **Felix**, and the limitation is that every minigame must be **exactly 7 seconds long**.

There are **almost no restrictions** related to the content of your game. We expect and hope to see all kinds of games, ranging from wholesome to gore.

We welcome creative and diverse ideas. However, we want to make it clear that any content promoting political extremism will not be accepted.

In case you are wondering, here's some information about Felix:

He's from **Hamburg**, and loves **beer, electronic music, and raves**. He's a fellow Game Dev, and his hobbies include:
* **Augmented Reality**
* Computer **Keyboards**
* **Bouldering**
* **Hunt: Showdown**

But don't be fooled: he's the most **wholesome** and **tender** guy ever. Do what you want with this info.

Oh, and most importantly. Felix has a **golden loop earring** and  always wears one of those **super short beanies** or a **baseball hat**.

Check the logo and sprites in the project for a reference.

### Getting started

First of all, you can download the project by simply cloning the repo or downloading it as a .ZIP archive. The project is developed in **Unity 2022.3.8f1**.

After opening it, please create a folder inside **02 YOUR GAME(S) HERE** and name it how you intend to name your game.

Once done, find the Template Scene inside **01 COMMON ASSETS** and copy paste it in your folder. It contains some *important stuff*, like our **camera setup** ( *don't change the aspect ratio!* ), a UI canvas that you can duplicate to create your own UI if needed, and an event system.

The common assets also include some animations of Felix in pixel art. Feel free to use your own art though, if you want!

If your game has a win condition, you **must** use

**`GoFelixManager.Instance.win = true`**
or
**`GoFelixManager.Instance.win = false`**

**The defalut state is `true`.**

### Handing in your minigame

We will make our best to accept any way of handing in your minigames, but these would be the preferable ways:

1. If you have experience using Git and GitHub, the best way would be for you to create a **pull request** to the main branch.
2. Export a **Unity Package** and upload it in a folder you previously created on **[this drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Jneb9vUqB7atdeC6yFA2M4hiEQdCK5R?usp=sharing)**.
3. Open your minigame folder in your file explorer, compress it into a **.ZIP** or **.RAR** archive and upload it in a folder you previously created on **[this drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Jneb9vUqB7atdeC6yFA2M4hiEQdCK5R?usp=sharing)**.

On a fixed basis, we will review your hand-ins and merge them into the main project.

### Project Guidelines

We are committing to maintain this project and keeping it tidy, so we would really appreciate if you could comply to some guidelines we created that *should* make our work proceed more smoothly.

|Rule| Purpose  |
|--|--|
|Use the correct version of unity. It is the **2022.3.8f1** version.| Having to upgrade or downgrade your project would cost lots of time and possibly corrupt / change some of your assets, creating undesired and unexpected results. |
| Refrain from creating, deleting, or moving around any file in the **00 DO NOT TOUCH (please)** folder. | All of the project settings, core scripts, scenes, sprites, etc. are located here. ***Feel free to copy these files in other locations and reuse them!***  |
| Create a folder inside the **02 YOUR GAME(S) HERE** for each of your minigames. You can find some examples of minigames in there already. All of the assets related to the minigame should be located in their respective folder. Again, you can peek at already existing minigames.  | It's very easy to get assets mixed up. But most importantly it's very easy to run into conflicts when merging your minigames in the main branch of the game. Having everything in different folders gets rid of this problem entirely. |
| The use of Unity tags and physics layers is prohibited. We know it's a strong limitation, but we're going to have to ask you to change your code to not use them if you do, before we can merge your minigame. We know it's inefficient, but consider using gameobject names instead of tags, and more complex collision conditions instead of physics layers. | Tags and Physics Layers are not scene or folder dependant in Unity: they are project wide, and can be easily overwritten. This is very time consuming and complicated to maintain if this project grows in scale.|
| Use specific names for your script rather than generic ones. For example, if your project's name is "UnderFelix" and you need to create a "Spawner" object, prefer calling it "UnderFelix_Spawner". An alternative to this is using Namespaces in C#. Please find documentation about namespaces [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces). | Again, when creating such short games and in such a short timespan, it's easy to trip in the pitafall of using generic names. It's rather easy then to have Classes and Monobehaviours with the same names creating errors which we would have to fix manually, losing lots of time.|
| Do not apply any overrides to already existing prefabs like the **Important Stuff** one. | Applying overrides to a prefab that is used in every scene may lead to the dirsuption of several other minigames. |
